            <div class="box sticky">

                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>You use the sticky position by selecting the position: sticky. Now when you scroll down, whatever is sticky will stay at the top of the page no matter how far you scroll.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box relative">

                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>The value I used for the top property is 30px and I used 0px for the left property. The more pixels in the left property, the more the box moved to the right. The more pixels in the top property, the more it moved down.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box fixed">

                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>The value I used for the top property is 60px and I used 0px for the right property. The more pixels in the top property, the more the box moved down. The more pixels in the right property, the more the box moved left.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box absolute">

                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>The value I used for the bottom property is 30px and I used 0px for the right property. More pixels in the bottom property moved the box up. More pixels in right property moved the box left. </p>
